This repository is associated with the paper _Multivariate hierarchical analysis of car crashes data considering a spatial network lattice_ by Andrea Gilardi, Jorge Mateu, Riccardo Borgoni and Robin Lovelace. 

The R code used to estimate the statistical models detailed in the paper and in the supplementary material is summarised in a series of scripts which are stored in the folder called `R`. 
The corresponding data objects are saved in the folder named `data`. 

The models were trained using the following packages: 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
